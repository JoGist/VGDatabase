# Here is some long exposition so that the Unit section is a lot further
# down the file than the Install section, so we are only relying on the
# Install section for the magic string comparison.
#
# It is interesting to note that there is no Device section because we
# cannot really set per-device options in files which are automatically
# generated, or in ones which are shipped with applications. You learn
# something new each day, right?
